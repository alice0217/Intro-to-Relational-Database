## Troubleshooting: ##
### The web forum doesn't show the time of when the message is posted.  ###

There is a problem in the forumdb_solved.py from Udacity source code. If you test it, the web forum won't show the time of when the message was posted, even though the tutorial did show time, because they only insert the message content into the table. To solve this problem, we need to import datetime from the datetime library.

Change this line 

`c.execute("insert into posts values (%s)", (bleach.clean(content),))`

to 

`c.execute("insert into posts values (%s, %s)", (bleach.clean(content), datetime.now(), ))`.
